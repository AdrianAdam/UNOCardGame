This is a school project made with Unity.

The objective is to make a card game like UNO, with all of its rules.

Currently there are no animations, no sound effects, and swap cards and change colours aren't implemented.

This project is based on a YouTube tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxH8FoddkVY
Please check the tutorials if you want to understand more about the base of the game.
